# Term 4 Competency Assessments
## Learning Objectives

### Design
#### Description
Gathers requirements, develops models and creates prototypes in a timely and effective manner to increase a project’s safety and success
Examples:
* Gathers full requirements for a project
* Understands the client’s needs
* Models a solution using the appropriate tools
* Relates and justifies the design process to the client
* Implements designs that are safe and effective
* Demonstrates awareness of how the design integrates into its environment
	
#### Developing
All 3 learning objectives are related to the same credit card validation project.

My main goal overall this term is to lead a larger and more complex project than I have before. I have been asigned the project of integrating 3D Secure into our credit card system. 3D Secure is a verification technology supported by major credit card providers.

I will be the lead developer on this project with some support from our lead designer. This project has a strict deadline. After some initial investigation into our current code for handling credit cards and also the documentation for this API, I intend on formulating a plan for building this feature that I will then validate with our development team.

The hope is to build on my skills in project management and time management.


### Engineering Tools
#### Description
Uses a broad range of Engineering tools, applications and software.
Examples:
* Designs equipment and systems using a variety of software packages
* Simulates mechanical and electronic systems using the appropriate tools
* Analyses systems, equipment and data using the correct tools
* Operates mechanical equipment in a lab or workshop safely and effectively
* Uses electronics and electrical equipment in a careful and accurate manner
* Develops software and scripts in a variety of environments and languages
* Uses computer software and systems in an appropriate manner
* Understands database concepts and usage and uses them effectively
* Researches and recommends new tools where existing tools are inadequate
* Chooses tools based on their comparative strengths and weaknesses
	
#### Developing
All 3 learning objectives are related to the same credit card validation project.

For the credit card project I am doing this term, I will be working heavily with Stripe's APIs. Stripe is a SaaS we use to handle and process credit cards. They provide an API for 3D Secure which we want to integrate into our application.

Stripe is a very popular provider of financial APIs so I am excited to get experience working with their APIs and plugins, both on the front-end and back-end.


### Computer Information Processing and Algorithms
#### Description
Understands the theoretical foundations of computer science and the practice of abstracting known methods to new problems
Examples:
* Designs automated software test tools
* Displays an ability to manipulate information
* Creates solutions from user specifications, given known system constraints
* Optimizes solutions to improve performance using coding best practices
* Acknowledges the practical limits of a system for problem solving
	
#### Developing
All 3 learning objectives are related to the same credit card validation project.

Never in my development experience have I worked with credit cards before. Credit card numbers and related information are sensitive informations. I want to learn best practices around handling credit card information.

Integrating this new 3D Secure service is also a breaking change to our credit card funding process. I will need to engineer a solution to ensure our existing customers with saved credit card information are unnaffected by this change. Only new credit cards should be verified with 3D Secure.
